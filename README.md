# VDS Class Project
# Group Number #8

This repository contains the implementation of a minimal BDD package in C++. 

This package implements the fundamental manipulation methods for ROBDDs as they were introduced in the lecture Verification of Digital Systems by Prof. Kunz. 

The package was implemented using the Test Driven Development (TDD) paradigm presented by Dr. Wedler.
