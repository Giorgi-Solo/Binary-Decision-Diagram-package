# Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) Package

This repository contains the implementation of a minimal BDD package in C++. 

This package implements the fundamental manipulation methods for ROBDDs as they were introduced in the lecture Verification of Digital Systems by Prof. Kunz. 

The package was implemented using the Test Driven Development (TDD) paradigm presented by Dr. Wedler.

* .github/workflows/ - contains .yml file that sets up GTest library and Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with GitHub Actions  
* benchmarks/iscas85/ - contains benchmarks used while running tests on the BDD package
* src/ - contains source code for the package and for the tests
